My goals for interactivity:

1. Multiple choice quiz selection
    Some will be simple button pressing but if I can figure it out I hope to also include voice answers or perhaps drawing sketches? The problem with those is just showing a "correct" or "incorrect" background... So may just stick with buttons to focus on the rest of the site.

2. JQuery word input
    I want part of my site to have a section where the user can type any word and then in the background it will be what they typed in different languages. Again, not sure if I will make it work... So not sure.
        Maybe also a hover function so that when you hover text of a different language it will show you what language it is.s
