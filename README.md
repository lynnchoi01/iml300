<b>So You Know English?</b>

This website project was an effort to show the unreal expectations many native English speakers in wealthier, monolingual countries have on other English speakers/learners.

By having the user go through a quiz of different languages to show the different ways languages are difficult to learn. Idioms, slang, nuances, etc are not easy to learn but many English speakers have that expectation. It sets a bad precedent and creates linguistic racism since even native speakers that do not fall under the white American/British norm tend to be viewed differently too based on how they use English.

It is important to acknowledge that English is not the only language out there and appreciate the diverse languages that exist in the world. Someone is not less intelligent based on their perceived English knowledge.
